Ok so, this is not much actually, just a silly hello world (tbh, I'm keeping it so I remember how to put images in posts in the homepage)

This is how I will highlight important stuff in posts:

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> this is a note, I'll use it to make things clearer or as a way to give tips.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span> this is a warning message, I'll use it to warn about potentially dangerous situations or to include disclaimers.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    <span class="label label-success">SUCCESS:</span> this is a success statement, it will tell you what the desired outcome is or inform you of useful features of programs etc.
</p>
