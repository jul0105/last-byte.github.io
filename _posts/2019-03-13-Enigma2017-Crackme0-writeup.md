## Introduction

Yesterday I bought the commercial edition of [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja/) and I wanted to test it out so I went looking for some interesting reverse engineering challenge. Since I SUCK at reverse engineering I decided to go for a simple crackme from the 2017 edition of the Enigma CTF called [Crackme 0](https://hackcenter.com/competition/train/1/Enigma-2017/Crackme-0). Now, I could've looked at the provided [C source code](https://shell-enigma2017.hackcenter.com/static/dc7f79bcb37030ddc9f001208767e999/crackme_0_empty.c) but what's the point in reverse engineering if you already have the source? :P
