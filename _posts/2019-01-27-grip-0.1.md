# Introduction
It has been in my mind for quite some time to learn Golang and write some pentesting-oriented tools lately. I've finally made up my mind and wrote a tool to inject fake RIPv2 routes in a network in Go that I called Golang RIP Injection Program (or GRIP for short). This is still in early development but it already works flawlessly so you can use it.

First things first, let's give credit where credit is due. Most (if not all) of the heavy lifting had already been done by my good friend [Lorenzo Nicolodi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-nicolodi-83a04420/) who explained in [great details](https://microlab.red/2018/04/06/practical-routing-attacks-1-3-rip/) how to perform these kind of attacks against common routing protocols (namely RIPv2, OSPF and BGP). He also owns a [repository](https://github.com/illordlo/exploits/tree/master/routing) where he hosts python code to do so.

    <span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> Yes, I know that RIPv2 is considered legacy by some and yes, I know my code sucks, I'm not a programmer. But there's still a ton of organizations who use RIPv2 as their internal routing protocol and this code works even though it seems like it was written by a monkey, so deal with it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
