title: Tactical Debriefing I - Offshore
subtitle: Lessons learned by pwning the Offshore pro lab by HTB
---
Greeting everyone, last is back! So, on the 28th of September I played the [RomHack](https://romhack.io) CTF with my fellow mates from [JBZ](https://jbz.team/) and we got third, thanks to a flag submitted at the last second (a CTF tactic to make the other teams relax and then pwn them at the last moment [;)](https://xkcd.com/541/). The prize for our ~~awkward~~ outstanding performance was a set of coupons for HTB's pro labs, either Rasta Labs or Offshore. I kind of randomly chosen Offshore, as I had seen from reviews that it was more realistic and less CTF-like.
