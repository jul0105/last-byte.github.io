# Introduction

This is a blogpost about how I keep my Macbook Pro ~~in~~secure. This post takes a lot from the following resources so kudos to them first:

- [MacOS Security and Privacy Guide ](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide)
- [Configuring MacOS Sierra to authenticate with YubiKey 4](https://medium.com/@ellenbeldner/configuring-macos-sierra-to-authenticate-with-yubikey-4-876a8ab81e07)

The idea behind this is to make it ~~impossible~~ very difficult for an attacker to take control of your device even with physical access. Now, impossible is nothing, and that's even more true in the security industry. <mark>Always expect an attacker to be able to fully compromise your device with physical access</mark>, it's just a matter of time. That does not mean you have to make it easier for him to compromise you: the more time you buy, the less likely the information he will retrieve will be of any use.
