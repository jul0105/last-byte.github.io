# Introduction

This is a blogpost about how I keep my Macbook Pro ~~in~~secure. This post takes a lot from the following resources so kudos to them first:

- [MacOS Security and Privacy Guide ](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide)
- [Configuring MacOS Sierra to authenticate with YubiKey 4](https://medium.com/@ellenbeldner/configuring-macos-sierra-to-authenticate-with-yubikey-4-876a8ab81e07)
