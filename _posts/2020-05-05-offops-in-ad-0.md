There is a [well known thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest) that makes one wonder whether a tree falling in a forest, with no one around to hear the sound of it hitting the ground, actually makes a sound at all. Well, I don't know about you my friend, but I know nothing about trees falling and botany in general! What I do know however is the sound some people make (sysadmins, mostly) when they see a entire forest go down. Yep, I'm talking Active Directory forests. Trust me, it's traumatic.

Ok, now that I have overtaken blank page anxiety (bear with me okay?) we can start talking more seriously. Recently I was involved in a internal penetration test of a big organization which had networks spread across many European countries. It was a multi-step operation, with my work being the second step, after the initial compromise performed by other guys who landed a shell on the frontend through a web application. I was tasked with further developing the beachhead inside the target network and taking control of their multi-forest environment. 

I expected some sort of a challenge, but what I found instead was a complete mess (from the security point of view of at least). A mess so big that in less than twenty minutes I had full control over two of their three forests, with only the third one missing. It took me roughly a day to compromise the third forest, mainly because I was slowed down by trying to get my head around the amount of information I had at my disposal, as we had to compile a report at the end of the operation and make the C-level understand that a compromised Active Directory forest means the attacker has full access to everything the forest contains: backups, databases, applications' sources, the clients' financial information... Take note folks, inventorize everything you loot!

With the last forest compromised I really had it all, including the servers' iLO interfaces (which can be used to obtain some pretty interesting kinetic effects as you can literally shut down the servers' cooling fans) and the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) console, from which I could basically CTRL-A + DEL the entire infrastructure. All in all, ~~an amusing operation~~ something that will take months to secure properly.

And here we arrive at the reason for this (short?) blog post series. Despite what some good friends of mine say (gne, [@Th3Zer0](https://twitter.com/Th3Zer0) and [@Smaury](https://twitter.com/smaury92)?) Active Directory is really interesting as a target, as it's a complicated mess of technologies and practices which technicians get wrong a Shittonâ„¢ of times! What I want to cover in these ~~useless rants~~ posts is the workings of the components that make (and often break) Active Directory environments. In this part (which is the zeroth one) we will have a look at how the ~~in~~famous Microsoft's implementation of the Kerberos authentication mechanism work, step by step. The idea of the series is to analyze each step, understand the assumptions behind it and how to turn those assumptions against our target. But first, da fuq's Kerberos?

At its core, Kerberos is an authentication protocol, period. It was first devised by the MIT, then Microsoft decided to use it (after customizing it a bit) as the basis for authentication across Active Directory.

At first it can seem complicated, but it really isn't.
