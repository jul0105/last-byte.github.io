In the [zeroth part](https://blog.notso.pro/2019-03-20-angr-introduction-part0/) of this serie we learnt how to perform some very basic symbolic execution of a simple binary. This time we are going to get a little bit more serious and we are going to talk about symbolic bitvectors and avoiding unwanted states to reduce execution times.
