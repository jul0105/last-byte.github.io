I told you in the [last post](https://blog.notso.pro/2019-03-26-angr-introduction-part2/) we would have tested angr on a reverse engineering challenge different from the ones we've seen so far in angr_ctf. Since I'm a ~~lamer~~ lazy person I did not want to completely reanalyze a new binary so I went for the one we saw in [this](https://blog.notso.pro/2019-03-13-Enigma2017-Crackme0-writeup/) post.
