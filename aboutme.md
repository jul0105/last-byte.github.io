My name is Federico Lagrasta a.k.a. last, I'm an Italian security researcher. I am a [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/), [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/), and [OSWE](https://www.offensive-security.com/awae-oswe/). I enjoy lockpicking and [acrobatic quadcopter ~~crashing~~ flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpP_eaYOmxg). I also play CTFs with my mates @ [JBZ Team](https://jbz.team/about/) and I'm a huge fan of [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1243/). Other than that I don't have much to showcase to be honest so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
